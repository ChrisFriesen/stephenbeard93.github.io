## Lantern Economics Survey 

Lantern Economics is a pilot project, looking to investigate the feasibility of bringing an entirely new approach to a discipline struggling to produce meaningful policy advice in an ever more complex and interconnected world. The Lantern philosophy breaks from conventional academia in almost every way, with its core ideas being that the economy is a complex system and so should be approached as such, that software and AI should be both standard tools and a framework for building/testing larger economic ideas and philosophies, and that the efforts of any economist searching for insights should feed into a larger, collaborative 'peer to peer' network.

We are looking for feedback from professional economists on the proposed Lantern project, and any time taken to complete the below survey would be hugely appreciated.

      <label><strong>7)A core concept of Lantern Economics is that the main aim of Economics is to allow decision makers to correctly understand the likely outcome of their policy choices.

      <label><strong>8)Another core concept is that ideas are only useful if well verified and well known. Given the controversy that surrounds competing economic theories, Lantern proposes to make the outputs of the Global Economic Model to be predictions of interest, such as stock market and bond market changes.

      <label><strong>9)Lantern Economics would create a platform for Economists to create sub-models which would then be integrated into the overall Global Economic Model.
