## Lantern Economics - The concept 

Lantern Economics is a pilot project, looking to investigate the feasibility of bringing an entirely new approach to a discipline struggling to produce meaningful policy advice in an ever more complex and interconnected world. The Lantern philosophy breaks from conventional academia in almost every way, with its core ideas being that the economy is a complex system and so should be approached as such, that software and AI should be both standard tools and a framework for building/testing larger economic ideas and philosophies, and that the efforts of any economist searching for insights should feed into a larger, collaborative 'peer to peer' network.   

## Why Economics Is Currently Broken

Note that the criticisms levelled in this paragraph against mainstream economic research does not focus on any particular ideology, but instead focuses on the methodology taken by the profession in attempting to gain insights into the workings of the world. The Lantern philosophy does not promote any particular ideology, but instead focuses on creating a system that allows economic theories to be meaningfully tested, their usefulness assessed and any insights they uncover to be fed into a larger framework.   

| Existing approach | Criticisms | Lantern's proposed approach |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Use of unmeasurable input factors  | bad | good |
| Treating Economics like a 'simple system' | bad | good |
| 'Silo' working | bad | good |
| Ideologically closed minded | bad | good |
| Severe underuse of technology | bad | good |
