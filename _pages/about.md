## Lantern Economics - The concept 

Lantern Economics is a pilot project, looking to investigate the feasibility of bringing an entirely new approach to a discipline struggling to produce meaningful policy advice in an ever more complex and interconnected world. The Lantern philosophy breaks from conventional academia in almost every way, with its core ideas being that the economy is a complex system and so should be approached as such, that software and AI should be both standard tools and a framework for building/testing larger economic ideas and philosophies, and that the efforts of any economist searching for insights should feed into a larger, collaborative 'peer to peer' network.   

## The Lantern Methodology

The Lantern philosophy does not promote any particular ideology, but instead focuses on creating a system that allows economic theories to be meaningfully tested, their usefulness assessed and any insights they uncover to be fed into a larger framework. Below is a step by step description of the proposed process that any researcher who collaborated with Lantern would go through:    

| Step | Description |
|-------|----------|
| Decide to work with Lantern | Great! You've had a clear piece of research in mind, but you don't just want to write another article which will gather dust. Instead, you want your work to contribute to a much larger project where it can feed into a collaborative systematic search to gain true economic insight. |
| Check you've got the right skills | Make sure that you have at least basic programming skills in Lanterns main programming language. | 
| Review the current Lantern Framework | The Lantern Framework is the scaffolding on which the Global Economic Model is built. This effectively breaks down the economy into different sectors (i.e., GDP prediction, Capital Markets and Flows, International trade, etc...) and maps out how these sectors communicate and how economic data flows from one sector to another. The proposed Lantern project is designed to be highly modular, meaning that you can translate your research into a small sub-model which fits into the overall framework. |      
| Submit a proposal | You've reviewed the framework and can see a gaping hole, so it's time to fill in the online form to propose a project. Your project will then be assessed by our panel 1) to make sure that a similar project does not already exist, 2) check that the key assumptions in your model are defensible (i.e. not clearly contradicted by real world evidence) 3) check that it is testable (i.e. that it makes predictions using readily available macroeconomic data and so can be tested on historic data and on future performance) and 4) to give it an overall score to assess its potential usefulness. |  
| Feedback | You will receive feedback on your project, which will have both input from our panel of economists and from our software engineers. The software engineers are responsible for making sure that work undertaken can integrate into the overall framework, and will therefore offer technical guidance and requirements on this |
| Approval and resource allocation | If your project is approved then you will be allocated resources. Resource allocation refers to Lantern staff time required to integrate your finished module within the overall framework. | 
| Build your sub-model | Build your sub-model | 
| Sub-model integration | Once complete and reviewed, your sub-model will be integrated into the main Lantern Framework. Integration does not mean that your sub-model will be used in the main framework, rather it means that it will be available for use. One of the founding concepts of Lantern is that an economy is a complex system, and so the true usefulness of your sub-model will only be revealed by testing its predictive capabilities when combined with numerous other versions of the Lantern Framework. Building software capable of automatically combining numerous sub-models within the Lantern framework and running their historic simulations is a major goal of the project. High performing models are much more likely to contain models with valuable economic insight, providing a way of scoring sub-models as well as building the best Global Economic Model possible. |
