## Lantern Economics - The concept 

Lantern Economics is a pilot project, looking to investigate the feasibility of bringing an entirely new approach to a discipline struggling to produce meaningful policy advice in an ever more complex and interconnected world. The Lantern philosophy breaks from conventional academia in almost every way, with its core ideas being that the economy is a complex system and so should be approached as such, that software and AI should be both standard tools and a framework for building/testing larger economic ideas and philosophies, and that the efforts of any economist searching for insights should feed into a larger, collaborative 'peer to peer' network.   

## The Lantern Methodology

The Lantern philosophy does not promote any particular ideology, but instead focuses on creating a system that allows economic theories to be meaningfully tested, their usefulness assessed and any insights they uncover to be fed into a larger framework. Below is a step by step description of the proposed process that any researcher who collaborated with Lantern would go through:    

| Step | Description |
|-------|----------|
| Decide to work with Lantern | Great! You've had a clear piece of research in mind, but you don't just want to write another article which will gather dust. Instead you want your work to contribute to a much larger project where it can feed into a collaborative systematic search to gain true economic insight. |
| Check you've got the right skills | Make sure that you have at least basic programming skills in Lanterns main programming language. | 
| Review the current Lantern Framework | The Lantern Framework is the scaffolding on which the Global Economic Model is built. This effectively breaks down the economy into different sectors (i.e. GDP prediction, Capital Markets and Flows, International trade, etc...) and maps out how these sectors communicate and how economic data flows from one sector to another. The proposed Lantern project is designed to be highly modular, meaning that you can translate your research into a small sub-model which fits into the overall framework.|
